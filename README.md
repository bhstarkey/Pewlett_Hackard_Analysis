# Pewlett Hackard Employee Analysis

## Overview

To help prepare for a large amount of employees reaching retirement age, we looked at employee data to get a list of who is close to retirement. We got the numbers of how many will be retiring from each department in the upcoming years, as well as a list of every employee who is close to retiring.

## Results

The employee data shows:

* The 2 positions with the most employees approaching retirement eligibility:

    * Senior Engineers with 25,916 employees.
    * Senior Staff with 24,926 employees.
    
* The 2 positions with the least employees approaching retirement eligibility:
    
    * Assistant Engineers with 1090 employees.
    * Managers with 2 employees
    
* Total fares:

    * Urban cities make 9.2 times more than Rural cities, and 2 times more than Suburban cities.
    * Suburban cities make 4.4 times more than Rural cities.

* Total drivers vs rides:
 
    * Rural cities have on average 1.6 drivers for each ride.
    * Suburban cities have on average 1.2 drivers for each ride.
    * Urban cities have on average .67 drivers for each ride.

* Looking at the graph of fares by week, the peaks tend to coincide with holidays.

## Recommendations

1. I would recommend that marketing is increased around holidays to increase potential fares.

2. It could be advantageous to incentivize drivers around holidays so that there are plenty of drivers available, and no loss of customers.

3. I would recommend trying to increase the number of drivers in the Suburban and Rural areas, as there are not nearly as many drivers in those areas. having a sign on bonus or something of the like could help remedy that dilemma.


## Challenges

There were a couple challenges with this dataset. There were no metrics on whether or not a driver was active, so that could have affected the number of drivers reported in each city. There also were not any metrics for length of a ride or duration that could give more information about each ride, and how much the cost per mile to the drivers is.

* Data Source: ride_data.csv & city_data.csv
